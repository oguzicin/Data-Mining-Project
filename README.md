## 📦 Features

### 📝 Text Input & Author Prediction
Users can paste any piece of text into the input field. After submitting, the backend processes the text and predicts the most likely author using machine learning models trained on TF-IDF, N-gram, and BERT embeddings.

### 🏷 Keyword Tagging
In addition to authorship, the app also extracts and displays relevant **tags** (keywords) summarizing the topic/content of the text.

### 📊 Visual Analysis (Future Scope)
Graphing tools to visualize author prediction confidence and tag frequency are planned for future versions.
